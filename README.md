working_py_omx
==============

Slightly modified version of PyOMX wrapper for omxplayer written in python. The functionality of this version of pyomx is similar to the original that can be found at https://github.com/jbaiter/pyomxplayer I just added a few runtime checks to avoid crashes if certain meta data in video files is not available etc.
